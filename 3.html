<h2>Bronze / lron Age</h2>
<p>
The Bronze Age is a prehistoric period that was characterized by the use of bronze<br>
in some areas proto-writing, and other early features of urban civilization.<br>
The Bronze Age is the second principal period of the three-age Stone-Bronze-Iron system,<br>
as proposed in modern times by Christian Jürgensen Thomsen, for classifying and studying ancient societies.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Iron Age is the final epoch of the three-age division of the prehistory and protohistory of humanity.<br>
It was preceded by the Bronze Age and the Stone Age (Paleolithic, Mesolithic, Neolithic, and Chalcolithic).<br>
The concept has been mostly applied to Europe and the Ancient Near East, and, by analogy, also to other parts of the Old World.<br>
The duration of the Iron Age varies depending on the region under consideration.<br>
It is defined by archaeological convention.<br>
The "Iron Age" begins locally when the production of iron or steel has been brought to the point where iron tools and weapons superior to their bronze equivalents become widespread.<br>
For example, Tutankhamun's meteoric iron dagger comes from the Bronze Age.<br>
In the Ancient Near East, this transition takes place in the wake of the so-called Bronze Age collapse, in the 12th century BC.<br>
The technology soon spread throughout the Mediterranean Basin region and to South Asia.<br>
Its further spread to Central Asia, Eastern Europe, and Central Europe is somewhat delayed, and Northern Europe was not reached until later, by about 500 BC.<br>
