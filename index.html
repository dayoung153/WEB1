<h2>Prehistoric Times</h2>
<p>
The term "prehistory" can refer to the vast span of time since the beginning of the Universe or the Earth,<br>
but more often it refers to the period since life appeared on Earth, or even more specifically to the time since human-like beings appeared.
</p>
<p>
In dividing up human prehistory in Eurasia, historians typically use the three-age system,<br>
whereas scholars of pre-human time periods typically use the well-defined geologic record and its internationally defined stratum base within the geologic time scale.<br>
The three-age system is the periodization of human prehistory into three consecutive time periods, named for their respective predominant tool-making technologies.<br>
