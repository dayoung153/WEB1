<h2>New stone Age</h2>
The Neolithic, also known as the ("New Stone Age"), the final division of the Stone Age,<br>
began about 12,000 years ago when the first developments of farming appeared<br>
in the Epipalaeolithic Near East, and later in other parts of the world.<br>
The Neolithic division lasted (in that part of the world) until the transitional period of the Chalcolithic<br>
from about 6,500 years ago (4500 BC), marked by the development of metallurgy, leading up to the Bronze Age and Iron Age.<br>
In other places the Neolithic lasted longer.<br>
In Northern Europe, the Neolithic lasted until about 1700 BC, while in China it extended until 1200 BC.<br>
Other parts of the world (including Oceania and the northern regions of the Americas) remained broadly in the Neolithic stage of development until European contact.<br>
